How can I create and configure an AWS EC2 instance using Ansible? I need to set up a basic EC2 instance with the following specifications:
 Create your own vpc
 Region: eu-west-1
 Instance Type: t2.micro
 AMI ID: A latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI (AMI ID may vary based on the region)
 Security Group: A security group allowing SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) access
 Key Pair: Use an existing key pair named MyKeyPair
Additionally, I would like to install and start a web server (Apache or Nginx) on this instance once it is up and running.
